# Tensorflow-keras-project
This project is implemented as a part of the 'Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp' course in Udemy.
Data on loan is taken from Lending club-the worlds largest lending company. Data is analysed and missing values are filled for multiple columns. Data is visualised using seaborn tools and columns which do not contribute to predict the target are dropped. Rows which have NaN or 0 values even after filling are dropped.
A model is created and evaluated to predict whether a borrower can repay the loan amount or not. 
The platform is created and supported by Udemy.
